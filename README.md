## Draw Steel! - Owlbear Plugin

An unoffical MCDM initiave tracker for Owlbear Rodeo.

Draw Steel! is a unoffical MCDM RPG initiave tracker. Born out of a yearn for a
better initiative digital tracker for the unnamed MCDM rpg, the repo strives to
provide a initiative tracker better suited for the rotating turns between friend
and foe.

## Installing

This extension cannot currently be installed as I have yet to host it anywhere.
Once it's hosted the manifest link will shared.
